This repository contains SQL queries designed to explore and analyze COVID-19 data. The analysis covers a wide range of topics, including infection rates, death rates, and vaccination progress across different countries and regions. The queries utilize data from two primary sources: COVID-19 cases and deaths (COVIDDEATHS table) and COVID-19 vaccinations (COVIDVACCINATIONS table).
